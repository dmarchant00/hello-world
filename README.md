## Hobbies
### Hiking
In my free time I enjoy hiking. This includes short hikes, along with longer hikes such as 14er's in Colorado. Some hikes I have done include:
1. Black Elk Peak
2. Mount Princeton
3. Greys and Torreys peaks

### Basketball
I grew up playing basketball. I was done playing organized basketball after highschool, but I still play intermurals and pick up.
